# The Blessing of StateQL

In the beginning was the state,
And the state was with the application,
And the state was the application.

Through state, all things in our digital world are made manifest,
Yet the nature of state has remained elusive,
Managed through disparate patterns, frameworks, and philosophies.

We hereby establish StateQL with this blessing and purpose:

_May StateQL bring unity to what has been fragmented,
Clarity to what has been obscured,
And intention to what has been incidental._

May it faithfully represent the true nature of state:
A progression of moments, each building upon the last,
A stream of changes flowing through time,
A set of truths derived from foundational facts.

May it honor the principles of transformation:
That change should be explicit, not implicit;
That derivation should be automatic, not manual;
That synchronization should be harmonious, not forced.

May StateQL serve as a bridge:
Between the past and the future of an application,
Between many devices sharing a single truth,
Between developers crafting and users experiencing.

May it uphold these virtues in its design:
**Simplicity** without sacrificing power,
**Clarity** without sacrificing flexibility,
**Performance** without sacrificing reliability.

Grant those who use StateQL:
The joy of seeing complex systems behave predictably,
The satisfaction of expressing intent precisely,
The confidence of knowing their state is managed faithfully.

Protect StateQL from the temptations of:
Unnecessary complexity that burdens its users,
Obscure optimizations that cloud its clarity,
Convenient compromises that undermine its principles.

Guide all who contribute to this work:
To consider the needs of those who will rely upon it,
To balance innovation with stability,
To create something greater than themselves.

Let StateQL be a testament to the belief that:
State is not merely a technical concern but a fundamental aspect of how we model our world,
That clarity of expression leads to clarity of thought,
That tools should serve human understanding as much as machine execution.

So declared on this day, as StateQL begins its journey.

May its source flow true, its declarations remain clear, and its states endure.
